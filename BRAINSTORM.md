## Charcot: Medical Programming Language Feature Ideas
### Date Started: April 08, 2025
### Last Updated: April 08, 2025

1. **Built-in Medical Data Types**
   - Native types like `BloodPressure`, `HeartRate`, `LabResult` with predefined ranges and units (e.g., mmHg, bpm).
   - Example: `bp = BloodPressure(120, 80)` or `LabResult("CBC", hemoglobin=13.5, wbc=7.2)` with auto-validation.

2. **Domain-Specific Syntax**
   - Readable syntax mimicking medical charts, e.g., `assess patient where condition = "diabetes"` or `prescribe dosage = 10mg when time = "morning"`.
   - Ultra-simple updates like `update meds for patient #123: add "lisinopril" 10mg daily`.

3. **HIPAA-Compliant Security by Default**
   - Automatic encryption, access logging, and anonymization for `patient_data` variables.
   - No extra setup—security is intrinsic.

4. **Temporal Logic for Scheduling**
   - Time-based operations like `schedule task "insulin" every 8 hours starting "08:00" for 7 days`.
   - Handles intervals, overlaps, and alerts natively.

5. **Interoperability with Standards**
   - Built-in support for HL7, FHIR, ICD-10, e.g., `fetch patient_record from FHIR where id = "12345"`.
   - Direct parsing into usable objects.

6. **Error Handling with Clinical Context**
   - Context-aware errors, e.g., `warning: "systolic BP missing for patient #123—check input"`.
   - Suggests medically relevant fixes.

7. **Simulation and Validation Tools**
   - Sandbox mode: `simulate patient vitals where age = 65, condition = "hypertension"`.
   - Validates code against medical guidelines (e.g., drug interactions).

8. **Seamless Change Tracking**
   - `track` keyword logs changes, e.g., `track dosage "metformin" = 500mg for patient #123`.
   - Timestamps and links to outcomes, spotting trends like dose adjustments.

9. **High Performance and Safety**
   - Compiles to a fast, safe language (e.g., Rust/C) with runtime medical logic checks.
   - Static analysis prevents errors like overdoses before execution.

10. **Electronic Device Integration**
    - Native IoT support, e.g., `connect device "glucometer" to patient #123` for real-time data.
    - Handles common protocols (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi) seamlessly.

11. **Unmatched EMR Development**
    - `record` structure for clinical workflows, e.g., `record patient #123: vitals, meds, notes`.
    - Syncs with EMR databases and standards effortlessly.
    - Version control: `commit changes to "patient_123.med" with message "adjusted BP meds"`.
    - History: `history of "patient_123.med"` shows timeline of commits.
    - Rollback: `revert "patient_123.med" to commit "2025-04-09"`.
    - Diffs: `diff "patient_123.med" between "2025-04-09" and "2025-04-10"`.
    - Timeline plots: `plot timeline from "patient_123.med" for "BloodPressure"`.
    - Team merge: `merge "patient_123.med" from doctor "456" into "hospital_db"`.

12. **Lab and Image Results Native Support**
    - `LabResult` type, e.g., `LabResult("glucose", value=250)` with range checks and alerts.
    - `ImageResult` type, e.g., `img = ImageResult("chest_xray.dcm", modality="XRAY")`, supports DICOM and annotations.

13. **AI Decision Support Integration**
    - `predict` function for AI models, e.g., `predict diagnosis from ImageResult("chest_xray.dcm") using "pneumonia_model"`.
    - Simplifies model integration for clinical decision support.

14. **Custom .med File Format**
    - `.med` files as output of Assessment and Plan, e.g., `patient_123.med`.
    - Assessment: Data snapshot, e.g., `assessment: condition="hypertension", bp=BloodPressure(140, 90)`.
    - Plan: Executable tasks, e.g., `prescribe "lisinopril" 10mg daily`, `request exam "chest_xray"`, `refer to "cardiology"`.
    - Patient-controlled encryption: `encrypt file "patient_123.med" with patient_key "xyz"`.
    - Queryable: `fetch labs from "patient_123.med" where date > "2025-01-01"`.
    - Syncs with EMRs/devices: `save "patient_123.med" to EMR "hospital_db"`.

15. **Diagnostic Criteria Libraries**
    - Pre-built libraries, e.g., `import parkinson_scale`, with steps ike `calculate_updrs(tremor=2, rigidity=1)`.
    - Easy use: `assess patient #123 with parkinson_scale` pulls data from `.med` files.
    - Custom scales: `define headache_scale: step1="duration > 4h", step2="unilateral pain"`.

16. **Scientific Research Support**
    - Trial data fetching: `fetch cohort from "hospital_db" where condition="diabetes" and age > 50`.
    - Randomization: `randomize cohort into 2 groups`.
    - Stats tools: `analyze cohort with t_test`, `compute p_value for variable "glucose"`.
    - Paper generation: `generate paper "Diabetes Trial 2025" with sections "intro", "methods", "results"`.

17. **Dashboarding and Visualization**
    - Graph generation: `plot vitals from "patient_123.med" as "line_graph"` or `plot cohort "trial_2025_diabetes" as "bar_chart"`.
    - Dashboards: `dashboard patient #123: vitals, labs, meds` for real-time case discussion.
    - Anonymized sharing: `share anonymized "patient_123.med" as "case_study_001" with team "neurology"`.

18. **Real-Time Alerts and Monitoring**
    - In-patient monitoring: `monitor patient #123 for HeartRate > 100 trigger "tachycardia_alert"`.
    - Integrates with hospital systems for instant staff alerts.

19. **Care Coordination**
    - Team updates: `notify team "cardiology" about patient #123: "new ECG results"`.
    - Links to dashboards or `.med` files for quick reference.

20. **Patient Education**
    - Handouts: `generate handout for patient #123: meds, diet, follow_up` in language "Spanish"`.
    - Pulls from `.med` Plan for tailored instructions.

21. **Billing and Coding**
    - Auto-claims: `bill patient #123 for "99213" with diagnosis "I10"`.
    - Validates codes against encounter data.

22. **Telemedicine Integration**
    - Virtual visits: `start tele_visit with patient #123 via "zoom"`.
    - Syncs `.med` data and device inputs in real-time.

23. **Medical Coding Standards Support**
    - ICD-10: `map diagnosis "hypertension" to ICD10 "I10"`, integrates with billing and EMRs.
    - SNOMED CT: `encode assessment with SNOMED "271737000" for "anemia"`, enhances granularity.
    - DSM: `assess patient #123 with depression_scale_DSM5` maps to `ICD10 "F32.0"`.

24. **Private Practice and Public Facility Support**
    - Private: `schedule patient #123 for "15min" on "2025-04-10"`, `bill private patient #123 for "99214" with insurance "BlueCross"`.
    - Public: `manage ward "ICU"`, `bill public patient #123 for "DRG-291" to "Medicare"`.
    - Insurance: `verify insurance "BlueCross" for patient #123`, adjusts billing with copays or rules.

25. **Insurance Audit Support**
    - Audit logs: `log audit for patient #123: billing, codes, services` (anonymized, e.g., `patient_hash_abc: 99213, I10, $75`).
    - Data masking: `mask "patient_123.med" for audit expose "billing_only"`.
    - Irregularity checks: `check billing for patient #123 against insurance "Medicare" rules`.
    - Secure sharing: `share audit "patient_123.med" with insurance "BlueCross" as "audit_001"`.

26. **Country-Agnostic Design**
    - Coding: `map diagnosis "hypertension" to ICD10 "I10" in "US"` or `ICD11 "BA00" in "UK"`.
    - Language: `generate handout for patient #123 in language "French"`.
    - Regulations: `encrypt "patient_123.med" per "GDPR" in "EU"` vs. `"HIPAA" in "US"`.
    - Billing: `bill patient #123 for 5000 "JPY" in "Japan"` or `"NHS" in "UK"`.
    - Time/Date: `schedule on "10/04/2025" in "US"` (MM/DD) vs. `"UK"` (DD/MM).

## Next Steps
- Mock up a country-switching script (e.g., US vs. Japan billing).
- Test multilingual outputs with `.med` files.l
